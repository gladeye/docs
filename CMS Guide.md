# CMS Guide

### CMS concepts

#### Traditional CMS

> Provide an end-to-end solution from editing content to displaying content via a theme system.

**Pros**
- Quick to build site using various available themes.
- Off-the-shelf support for previewing content **while** editing.
- High performance in content delivery.

**Cons**
- *Front-end* implementation is bound to limitations of the theme system.
- Impossible to separate *back-end* and *front-end* concerns (e.g programming language, hosting...) due to its coupled nature.
- Tricky to add additional security layers on just *back-end* only.


#### Headless CMS

> Focus only on content editing, with content APIs for custom front-end implementation.

**Pros**
- Freedom to pick the **right** technology for *front-end* part of the site.
- Having a single source of truth (data) makes it easy to distribute contents via multiple channels, e.g mobile app, affiliate sites...
- Easy to add additional security layers to *back-end* without any compromises to *front-end*.

**Cons**
- Require additional work for content previewing.
- Ensuring fast and efficient content delivery can be tricky.
- Sharing authentication session between *back-end* and *front-end* is challenging.


### CMS platforms

#### Content as a Service (CaaS)

> On demand content delivering service, e.g [prismic.io](http://prismic.io),  [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)

**Pros**
- Zero hassle on maintenance.
- Minimal *back-end* work required.

**Cons**
- Design is bound to limitations of the service capabilities.
- Potentially high on-going cost.


#### Self-hosted CMS

> Hosting yourself CMS system, e.g [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Craft](https://craftcms.com/)

**Pros**
- Freedom to fully customise content models to fit with design.
- No on-going cost (hosting cost still applied however).
- Can be configured to be either traditional or headless CMS.

**Cons**
- Required frequent maintenances to stay well performed and secured.
